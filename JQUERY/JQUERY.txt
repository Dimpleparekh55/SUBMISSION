• What is jQuery?
Ans. jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document
traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web
development. jQuery is designed to change the way that you write JavaScript.
jQuery is a multi-browser JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side
scripting of HTML. It was released in January 2006 at BarCamp NYC by John Resig. It
is currently developed by a team of developers led by Dave Methvin. Used by over
55% of the 10,000 most visited websites, jQuery is the most popular JavaScript
library in use today.
jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM
elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery
also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript
library. This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and
animation, advanced effects and high-level, theme-able widgets. The modular
approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages
and web applications.

jQuery includes the following features:
Events
Effects and animations
Ajax
Extensibility through plug-ins
Utilities - such as user agent information, feature detection
Multi-browser (not to be confused with cross-browser) support.

Ans. With jQuery you can create a sliding effect on elements.

jQuery has the following slide methods:

slideDown()
slideUp()

The jQuery slideDown() method is used to slide down an element.

Syntax:

$(selector).slideDown(speed,callback);
The optional speed parameter specifies the duration of the effect. It can take the following values: "slow", "fast", or milliseconds.

The optional callback parameter is a function to be executed after the sliding completes.

The jQuery slideUp() method is used to slide up an element.

Syntax:

$(selector).slideUp(speed,callback);
The optional speed parameter specifies the duration of the effect. It can take the following values: "slow", "fast", or milliseconds.

The optional callback parameter is a function to be executed after the sliding completes.

The jQuery slideToggle() method toggles between the slideDown() and slideUp() methods.

If the elements have been slid down, slideToggle() will slide them up.

If the elements have been slid up, slideToggle() will slide them down.

$(selector).slideToggle(speed,callback);
The optional speed parameter can take the following values: "slow", "fast", milliseconds.

The optional callback parameter is a function to be executed after the sliding completes.
